### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML, CSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.JS, MongodDB, and Express.js to code this project.

For this fullstack app I wanted to focus on character creation and implementing CRUD put requests by updating the traits for each character. This anime is near and dear to me so I set out in creating characteristics based on concepts from the show such as ki repesenting energy reserves a character can have, or eating a senzu bean to replenish stamina, or training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to gain strength. I set up my front and back end to interact with each other through event listeners that were attached to the buttons being created with each character's list item element. I set up the event listeners to parse through arrays of each button so that it could respond/edit/delete the correct corresponding character line in the DOM. Overall, I was really happy with my code and how I incorporated soemthing personal to this project. 

### Lessons Learned :

- I have learned how to interact with nodes in the DOM especially on the front end much more 
- My debugging practices are much better and have helped me determine what I am targeting with my code which has been instrumental in my progress in communicating between the front end, back end, and my database. 
-This project taught me more about database information and how json interacts with MongoDB to provide the correct information.
